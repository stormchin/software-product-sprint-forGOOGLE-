      <h2 class="main">BIO</h2>
      <p>I am a first-generation immigrant from Jamaica. I was born in Atlanta, but grew up in Kingston, Jamaica until my parents decided to move back. I am currently study Computer Science and Mathematics at Morehouse College. I have strong passion for tech and programming, however, if I am not behind a computer, I am enjoying mother nature. I love all outdoor activities. My favorite activities include scuba diving, snowboarding, basketball, and kayaking.
      </p>
      <p>I spend most of my time pursuing my passions in technology. I'm a self taught in python and basic html/css. In school I learn C++ , but I feel more comfortable coding in python. I feel as of the applications of programming and general computer knowledge is very useful and necesssary skill in today's world.</p>

      <h2 class="main">Photography</h2>
      <p>Here are some photos from my travels!! I loves taking pictures of nature, particularly the ocean. The way the light bounces off the turqouise water is relaxing, mesmerizing and unlike anything on this planet. </p>
